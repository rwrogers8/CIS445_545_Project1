        <p1>I have played soccer since the time I was in 1st grade, and it has become a huge part of my life. While I will be done playing
            at the end of this fall, I will be helping to coach the University in my hometown upon my graduation. Whether it is playing Soccer
            or watching it, the sport always seems to find a way in to my life. Enjoy a few pictures of me playing soccer below!

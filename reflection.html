        <p1>In my time at Bradley, I have taken some awesome courses.
            Some of my favorites include:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>CS 360 - Introduction to Data Science</li>
            <li>CS 370 - Database Management Systems</li>
            <li> CS 462 - Machine Learning</li>
            <li> CS 463 - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</li>
            <br>
        </p1>
    </div>

        <p1>Clearly, in my studies, I have taken an interest in topics
            surrounding data science, and data in general. This is what
            lead me to pursuing an internship at Merck as a database programming
            intern in the summer of 2022. In this position, my academic experience
            and coursework definitely helped. It is nice to have learned so many technical skills
            in several different courses, but I think the criticial thinking skills I have
            picked up through projects has been the most valuable. Please find below table (created with the HTML
            table attribute) that gives some information about some of my favorite courses I have taken at
            Bradley. These will be scored on my grade received, valuable skills learned, degree requirement, professor,
            and location of the class.

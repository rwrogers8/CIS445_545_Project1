        <p1>In my time at Bradley, I have taken some awesome courses.
            Some of my favorites include: 
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>CS 360 - Introduction to Data Science</li>
            <li>CS 370 - Database Management Systems</li>
            <li> CS 462 - Machine Learning</li>
            <li> CS 463 - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</li>
            <br>
        </p1>

        <p1>Clearly, in my studies, I have taken an interest in topics
            surrounding data science, and data in general. This is what
            lead me to pursuing an internship at Merck as a database programming
            intern in the summer of 2022. In this position, my academic experience
            and coursework definitely helped. It is nice to have learned so many technical skills 
            in several different courses, but I think the criticial thinking skills I have
            picked up through projects has been the most valuable.
